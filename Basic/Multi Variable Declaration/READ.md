### Multiple Variable Declaration in Java

In Java, you can declare multiple variables of the same data type in a single statement by separating them with commas. This makes the code more concise and readable. However, all variables declared together must share the same data type.

### Syntax:

dataType variable1, variable2, variable3;

You can also assign values while declaring multiple variables:

dataType variable1 = value1, variable2 = value2, variable3 = value3;


### Multivariable Declaration Problem:
### Team Performance Tracker
A sports analyst tracks player performance in a football match.
Use int for goals and assists (whole numbers) and double for player ratings (decimal values) while declaring multiple variables in a single statement for efficiency.

Expected Output:
```html
Goals Scored: 3  
Assists Made: 2  
Shots on Target: 5  
Player 1 Rating: 8.5  
Player 2 Rating: 7.9
```
